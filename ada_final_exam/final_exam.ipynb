    "Attention, ADA students!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sheldon Cooper we all know and love (OK, some of us might not know him, and some might not love him) from the TV series \"The Big Bang Theory\" has gotten into an argument with Leonard from the same TV show. Sheldon insists that he knows the show better than anyone, and keeps making various claims about the show, which neither of them know how to prove or disprove. The two of them have reached out to you ladies and gentlemen, as data scientists, to help them. You will be given the full script of the series, with information on the episode, the scene, the person saying each dialogue line, and the dialogue lines themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leonard has challenged several of Sheldon's claims about the show, and throughout this exam you will see some of those and you will get to prove or disprove them, but remember: sometimes, we can neither prove a claim, nor disprove it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deadline\n",
    "Wednesday, January 30th, 2019; 11:15 A.M. (Swiss time)\n",
    "\n",
    "_For the deadline for extramural exams, see the submission subsection._\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important notes\n",
    "* Don't forget to add a textual description of your thought process, the assumptions you made, and your results!\n",
    "* Please write all your comments in English, and use meaningful variable names in your code.\n",
    "* As we have seen during the semester, data science is all about multiple iterations on the same dataset. Do not obsess over small details in the beginning, and try to complete as many tasks as possible during the first 2 hours. Then, go back to the obtained results, write meaningful comments, and debug your code if you have found any glaring mistake.\n",
    "* Fully read the instructions for each question before starting to solve it to avoid misunderstandings, and remember to save your notebook often!\n",
    "* The exam contains **15 questions organised into 4 tasks**, and is designed for more than 3 hours. **You do not need to solve everything in order to get a 6**, and you have some freedom is choosing the tasks you wish to solve.\n",
    "* You cannot leave the room in the first and last 15 minutes.\n",
    "* You can use all the online resources you want except for communication tools (emails, web chats, forums, phone, etc.). We will be monitoring the network for unusual activity.\n",
    "* Remember, this is not a homework assignment -- no teamwork allowed!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "* Your file has to be named as \"NameSurname_SCIPER.ipynb\".\n",
    "* Make sure you upload your Jupyter Notebook (1 file) to [this](https://goo.gl/forms/7GLvYl94uSOn54jH2) Google form at the end of the exam, with all the cells already evaluated (except for the Spark-related question, Q7). You need to sign in to Google using your EPFL credentials in order to submit the form.\n",
    "* In case of problems with the form, send your Jupyter Notebook (along with your name and SCIPER number) as a direct message to @ramtin on Mattermost. This is reserved only for those who encounter problems with the submission -- you need to have a reasonable justification for using this back-up.\n",
    "* You will have until 11:20 (strict deadline) to turn in your submission. **Late submissions will not be accepted.** This deadline is for the students taking the exam at EPFL -- students taking the exam extramurally will have their submission deadline as the starting time of the exam plus 3 hours and 5 minutes."

    "**Note: You will use the data you preprocess in this task in all the subsequent ones.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our friends' argument concerns the entire show. We have given you a file in the `data/` folder that contains the script of every single episode. New episodes are indicated by '>>', new scenes by '>', and the rest of the lines are dialogue lines. Some lines are said by multiple people (for example, lines indicated by 'All' or 'Together'); **you must discard these lines**, for the sake of simplicity. However, you do not need to do it for Q1 in this task -- you'll take care of it when you solve Q2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1**. (5 points) Your first task is to extract all lines of dialogue in each scene and episode, creating a dataframe where each row has the episode and scene where a dialogue line was said, the character who said it, and the line itself. You do not need to extract the proper name of the episode (e.g. episode 1 can appear as \"Series 01 Episode 01 - Pilot Episode\", and doesn't need to appear as \"Pilot Episode\"). Then, answer the following question: In total, how many scenes are there in each season? We're not asking about unique scenes; the same location appearing in two episodes counts as two scenes. You can use a Pandas dataframe with a season column and a scene count column as the response.\n",

    "**Q2**. (5 points) Now, let's define two sets of characters: all the characters, and recurrent characters. Recurrent characters are those who appear in more than one episode. For the subsequent sections, you will need to have a list of recurrent characters. Assume that there are no two _named characters_ (i.e. characters who have actual names and aren't referred to generically as \"little girl\", \"grumpy grandpa\", etc.) with the same name, i.e. there are no two Sheldons, etc. Generate a list of recurrent characters who have more than 90 dialogue lines in total, and then take a look at the list you have. If you've done this correctly, you should have a list of 20 names. However, one of these is clearly not a recurrent character. Manually remove that one, and print out your list of recurrent characters. To remove that character, pay attention to the _named character_ assumption we gave you earlier on. **For all the subsequent questions, you must only keep the dialogue lines said by the recurrent characters in your list.**\n",

    "**Q7**. (7.5 points) Write a Spark script that does the following: Given the raw input file and your list of recurrent characters, create an RDD containing (speaker, dialogue line) rows **only for the recurrent characters** (assume that you already have the list --  no need to calculate it using Spark), and then generate a vectorized bag of words representation for each dialogue line, thus generating an RDD with (speaker, bag of words vector) rows. Then, calculate an aggregated bag of words vector (sum of all vectors) for each person. The final output is therefore an RDD with each of its rows being (speaker, aggregated bag of words vector). For your bag of words vectors, you can use $1\\times|V|$ scipy CSR matrices (where $|V|$ is the size of the vocabulary). No filtering of the vocabulary is necessary for this part.\n",

Now, use the scikit-learn class **TfIdfVectorizer** to create TF-IDF representations for the data points in your training and test sets.
